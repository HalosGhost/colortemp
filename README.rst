This is my personal fork and copy of Tedu's `sct <http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/sct-set-color-temperature>`_.

I cleaned up the code (a bit), pared it down to the necessary parts and may, in the future add some extra features (e.g., querying the current color temperature / a very simple daemon Ã  la redshift).
